# `Spark`
### A Cross Platform Port of Facebook's C++ Linter

`Spark` is cross-platform, zero-dependency port of `flint`, a lint program for C++ developed and used at Facebook.

`flint` is published on Github at https://github.com/facebook/flint; for discussions, there is a Google group at https://groups.google.com/d/forum/facebook-flint.

Why Lint?
---------

Linting is a form of *static-code analysis* by which common errors and bad practices are flagged for review. This can help to both optimize poorly written code and to set a unified code style for all the code in a project. For large organizations this can be tremendously powerful as it helps to keep the whole codebase consistent.

Dependencies
------------

### Windows, Unix, Linux, OSX

**None!** You're good to go! Happy linting :)
